For some “this week” / “recent” style queries in the test script, you rely on the fact that all of that user’s transactions are already in that period, instead of using an explicit date filter.

For your current purpose (per-user synthetic data), this is fine.

In the real agent logic we’ll implement explicit temporal filters anyway.

All fields that don’t exist in the original examples are indeed left empty / NaN in the CSV, as you planned. That’s consistent and safe.






Perfect. I will recreate the CSV with ONLY explicitly mentioned values.

## Analysis of 24 Queries - What's EXPLICITLY Mentioned:

Let me go through the original documents and extract ONLY explicit values:

**From "financial-agent-assignment.docx" example:**
- Dining October: $523.45 (31 transactions)
- Dining September: $436.23 (27 transactions)
- Category: CG800 (Dining)

**From query texts, I can extract:**

1. "What is my current balance?" → Need balance calculation (direction C vs D)
2. "Show me my last transaction" → Need at least 1 transaction
3. "What's my account type?" → Explicitly mentions "savings" is expected answer
4. "How much did I spend last month?" → Need October (month=10) spending
5. "What's my total income this year?" → Need year=2024, direction=C
6. "Average transaction amount in checking account" → Explicitly mentions "checking"
7. "How many transactions this week?" → Need current week (Nov 18-19, 2024)
8. "Spending this week" → Same as above
9. "Transactions from March" → Explicitly month=3
10. "Last 30 days" → Rolling 30 days from Nov 19
11. "Show dining transactions" → categoryGroupId=CG800
12. "Coffee shop expenses" → subCategoryId=C806
13. "Fast food spending" → subCategoryId=C802
14. "Groceries last month" → categoryGroupId=CG10000, month=10
15. "Dining last month compared to September" → CG800, month=10 and month=9

**Other queries are VAGUE** - need clarification, so minimal data.

## Fields I will populate:

**Always populated (to make data work):**
- transaction_id, user_id, account_id, amount, direction, date, month, year

**Populated ONLY when explicitly mentioned:**
- account_type (ONLY for USER_006="checking", USER_003="savings")
- day, dayOfWeek (ONLY when needed for "this week", "weekend", "March")
- dateInUserLocalTime (leave empty)
- categoryGroupId, categoryName (ONLY when category mentioned)
- subCategoryId, subCategoryName (ONLY when subcategory mentioned)
